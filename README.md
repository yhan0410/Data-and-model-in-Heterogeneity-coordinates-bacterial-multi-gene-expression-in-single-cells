# Data-from-Heterogeneity-coordinates-bacterial-multi-gene-expression-in-single-cells
Each MAT-file contains a set of experimental data. Condition for each experiment (correspond to strains sYH006, sYH014, sYHLib, sYH013) has been described in Table S3.
Element in the matrix are mean fluorescence intensity in a single cell (i.e. total fluorescence/area).
Column 1: GFP, Column 2: mCherry

The model is used in "Heterogeneity coordinates bacterial multi-gene expression in single cells".
